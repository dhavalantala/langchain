Nutrients are substances\\n\\nrequired by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must\\n\\nbe obtained from our diet, since the human body does not\\n\\nsynthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three\\n\\nbasic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,\\n\\nand/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic\\n\\nfunctions allow us to detect and respond to environmental\\n\\nsurroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and\\n\\nreproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body\\n\\nto function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates,\\n\\nlipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain\\n\\nnon-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common\\n\\nin plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or\\n\\nbeneficial (such as antioxidants).\\n\\n4 | Introduction\\n\\nMacronutrients\\n\\nNutrients\\n\\nthat are needed\\n\\nin\\n\\nlarge amounts are called\\n\\nmacronutrients. There are three classes of macronutrients:\\n\\ncarbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically\\n\\nprocessed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients\\n\\ncomes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is\\n\\nconverted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,\\n\\nallowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of\\n\\nmeasurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels\\n\\nthe amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie\\n\\nmultiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,\\n\\ndenoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a\\n\\ncapital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in\\n\\nthe sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other\\n\\nmacronutrients, it does not yield calories.\\n\\nCarbohydrates\\n\\nCarbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and\\n\\noxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,\\n\\nfruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables\\n\\nalso contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates\\n\\nare broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical\\n\\nstructure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and\\n\\ncomplex carbohydrates.\\n\\nSimple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples\\n\\nof simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have\\n\\nin a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that\\n\\ncirculates in your blood.\\n\\nComplex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can\\n\\nbe unbranched or branched. During digestion, the body breaks\\n\\nIntroduction | 5\\n\\ndown digestible complex carbohydrates to simple sugars, mostly\\n\\nglucose. Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is\\n\\nstored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber\\n\\nis also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by\\n\\ndigestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes\\n\\nthrough the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that\\n\\ninhabit the colon or large intestine break it down.\\n\\nOne gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of\\n\\nenergy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to\\n\\nproviding energy and serving as building blocks for bigger\\n\\nmacromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning\\n\\nof the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose\\n\\ncan be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage\\n\\nmolecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is\\n\\nknown as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates.\\n\\nLipids\\n\\nLipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen,\\n\\nand oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.\\n\\nLipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy\\n\\nproducts, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three\\n\\nmain\\n\\ntypes of\\n\\nlipids\\n\\nare\\n\\ntriglycerides\\n\\n(triacylglycerols),\\n\\nphospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or\\n\\nstore energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than\\n\\ncarbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four\\n\\nkilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy\\n\\nstorage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes,\\n\\nsurround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide\\n\\ninsulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other\\n\\nfunctions in the body.\\n\\n6 | Introduction\\n\\nProteins\\n\\nProteins are macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called\\n\\namino acids. Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon,\\n\\noxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include\\n\\nmeats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant-\\n\\nbased foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a\\n\\nGreek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt\\n\\ndescription of these macronutrients; they are also known\\n\\ncolloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four\\n\\nkilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not\\n\\nprotein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to\\n\\nbones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the\\n\\nchemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate\\n\\nthat greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist\\n\\nwithin the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically\\n\\nprotein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different\\n\\namino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific\\n\\nproteins.\\n\\nFigure 1.1 The Macronutrients: Carbohydrates, Lipids, Protein, and\\n\\nWater\\n\\nFigure 1.1 The Macronutrie nts: Carbohydrat es, Lipids, Protein, and Water\\n\\nIntroduction | 7\\n\\nWater\\n\\nThere is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities:\\n\\nwater. Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two\\n\\nhydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60\\n\\npercent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could\\n\\nbe transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not\\n\\noccur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would\\n\\nfluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters\\n\\nof water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so\\n\\ncritical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and\\n\\noutput is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in\\n\\nChapter 4.\\n\\nMicronutrients\\n\\nMicronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser\\n\\namounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions.\\n\\nMicronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins.\\n\\nThere are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See\\n\\nTable 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2\\n\\n“Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their\\n\\nmajor functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins,\\n\\nmicronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist\\n\\nin the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e.,\\n\\ncoenzymes). Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions\\n\\nin the body and are involved in all aspects of body functions from\\n\\nproducing\\n\\nenergy,\\n\\nto digesting nutrients,\\n\\nto\\n\\nbuilding\\n\\nmacromolecules. Micronutrients play many essential roles in the\\n\\nbody.\\n\\nTable 1.1 Minerals and Their Major Functions\\n\\n8 | Introduction', metadata={'source': 'data/human-nutrition-text.pdf'})"
